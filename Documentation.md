## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 WeatherApp

Our weather app is a responsive weather dashboard that allows users to search for weather data by city, displays real-time information using a free weather API, and stores recent searches in local storage, all within a Dockerized environment.

|------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a user, I want to search for weather data by entering a city name, so that I can get the current weather information for that location.                                                                                                      |
| 2    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a user, I want to use a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data, so that I can receive accurate and up-to-date information.                                                                                                      |
| 3    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a user, I want to have a responsive and stylish UI, so that I can easily navigate and view weather data.                                                                                                      |
| 4    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a user, I want to display weather data in a clean, user-friendly way, including temperature, humidity, and weather icons, so that I can quickly understand the weather conditions.                                                                                                      |
| 5    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a user, I want to save the last few searched locations in local storage, so that I can quickly reselect them without retyping.                                                                                                      |
| 6    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a developer, I want to set up a Docker container to serve the app using a lightweight web server (like Nginx or a simple Node.js server), so that the application can run efficiently in different environments.                                                                                                      |
| 7    |  Must        |  Functional               | As a developer, I want to create a Dockerfile to define the container and a docker-compose.yml file, so that it is easy to run the app locally and manage dependencies.                                                                                                      |
| 8    |  Can        |   Functional              | As a developer, I want to push my Docker image to Docker Hub, so that I can easily deploy the app on any Docker-compatible platform in the future.                                                                                                      |
